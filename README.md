# QT_segmentation_DICOM
Dicom image processing using Qt (5, plus use Mingw 64) interface and python (3) in backend

Welcome to this project! 
If you are reading this with the intention of improoving the project:
  -first of all good luck. DICOM is a dark place where nobody want's to go.
  -this project is mainly commented, it should make things easier but if you have a problem feel free to contact me. 
  -You WILL NEED DICOM FILES with the .DCM windows extention. Some of them are lacking the '.dcm' sometimes, run 
    rn *.* *.dcm 
  in the command prompt in the folder, it should do the trick.
