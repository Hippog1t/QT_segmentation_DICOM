Welcome to this project! \n
If you are reading this with the intention of using or improving the project:\n
  -first of all good luck. DICOM is a dark place where nobody wants to go.\n
  -this project is mainly commented, it should make things easier but if you have a problem feel free to contact me. \n
  -You WILL NEED DICOM FILES with the .DCM windows extention. Some of them are lacking the '.dcm' sometimes, run \n
    ren \*.\* \*.dcm \n
    in the command prompt in the folder, it should do the trick.\n
    There should be an example for you to load in the Ressources files\n
  -You also need to install SimpleITK, matplotlib, pillow with your python version \n
  pip install *stuff*\n
  or \n
  conda install *stuff*\n
  should work on your python command prompt.\n
