Welcome to this project! 
If you are reading this with the intention of improoving the project:
  -first of all good luck. DICOM is a dark place where nobody want's to go.
  -this project is mainly commented, it should make things easier but if you have a problem feel free to contact me. 
  -You WILL NEED DICOM FILES with the .DCM windows extention. Some of them are lacking the '.dcm' sometimes, run 
    rn \*.\* \*.dcm 
    in the command prompt in the folder, it should do the trick.
    There should be an example for you to load in the Ressources files
  -You also need to install SimpleITK, matplotlib, pillow with your python version
  pip install *stuff*
  or 
  conda install *stuff*
  should work on your python command prompt.
